                We may terminate or suspend Your access immediately, without prior notice or
                liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if You breach
                these Terms and Conditions. <br> <br>

                Upon termination, your right to use the Service will cease immediately. <br> <br>

            <p><span>Limitation of Liability</span> <br>
                We may terminate or suspend Your access immediately, without prior notice or
                liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if You breach
                these Terms and Conditions. <br> <br>

                Upon termination, your right to use the Service will cease immediately. <br> <br>

                To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or
                its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages
                whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or
                other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy
                arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service,
                third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in
                connection with any provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been
                advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential
                purpose. <br> <br>

                Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability
                for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations
                may not apply. In these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest
                extent permitted by law. <br> <br>
            </p>

            <p><span>"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer</span> <br>
                The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects
                without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the
                Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective
                licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express,
                implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all implied
                warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement,
                and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or
                trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or
                undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your
                requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software,
                applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or
                reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be
                corrected. <br> <br>

                Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider
                makes any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the
                operation or availability of the Service, or the information, content, and materials or
                products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free;
                (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided
                through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent
                from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms,
                malware, timebombs or other harmful components.<br> <br>

                Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations
                on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and
                limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set
                forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable 
                law.<br> <br>
            </p>

            <p><span>Governing Law</span> <br>
                The laws of the Country, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Terms and
                Your use of the Service. Your use of the Application may also be subject to other local,
                state, national, or international laws. <br> <br>
